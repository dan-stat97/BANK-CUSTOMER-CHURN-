# BANK-CUSTOMER-CHURN-

Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the tendency of clients or customers to abandon a brand and cease being a paying client of a specific business or organization. A customer churn rate is the percentage of customers who stop using a company's services or products during a specific time period. A customer may leave after a series of bad experiences (or even just one). And if a large number of dissatisfied customers leave at the same time, the financial and reputational costs would be enormous.

I build a model using logistics regression machine learning approaches to predict the best outcome.
